# CTSTextservice
API for CTS/CITE returns URNs and Nodes in JSON format

## Get Started
1. Download the zipped Repo
2. Unpack it (You can rename it afterwards if you like)
3. Open a Terminal/Commandline and cd into the unpacked (and optionally renamed) folder
4. On Mac/Linux: start it up with `./UnixCTS` 

## Trouble-shooting

You might have to tell your Operating system that `./UnixCTS` is an executable with `chmod +x UnixCTS`

## Try it with your favourite browser

1. http://localhost:8080/cex/hmt-scholia-onormal/urns
2. http://localhost:8080/cex/hmt-scholia-onormal/nodes

## Adding your own CEX

1. Drag & Drop to `static/cex`

## Modify it to meet your needs:

`config.json` is pretty much self-explicable.
